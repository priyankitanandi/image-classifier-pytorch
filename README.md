# image-classifier-pytorch
Image classification neural network model demonstration using Pytorch. If you are wondering how to build a model in Pytorch then go through this notebook. The Fashion MNIST dataset is made up of images from fashion chain: Zalando. It contains a training set of 60,000 images, and a test set of 10,000 images. Each image is a 28 x 28 gray scale image associated with the label from 10 classes. Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels. Label zero refers to a T-shirt. Label one is a trouser, and so on. Train a neural network model so that it can distinguish between the different classes of objects. What do the different images in the dataset look like?
